===========[  ]============

when program is run, the CPU begins execution at the top of main(), executes some number
of statements (in sequential order by default), and then terminates at the end of main().

the specific sequence of statements tht the CPU executes is called the program's execution
path (or path for short).

the execution path can be affected using control flow statements.
these are statements that allow the programmer to change the normal path of execution
through the program

conditional statements      cause a sequence of code to execute only if some condition is met                                               if, switch
jumps                       tell the CPU to start executing the statements at some other location                                           goto, break, continue
function calls              are jumps to some other location and back                                                                       Function calls, return
loops                       tell the program to repeatedly execute some sequence of code zero or more times, until some condition is met    while, do-while, for, ranged-for
halts                       tlls the program to quit running                                                                                std::exit(), std::abort()
exceptions                  are special kind of flow control structure designed for error handling                                          try, throw, catch
