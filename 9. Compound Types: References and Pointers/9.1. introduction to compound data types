/*
  - compound data types are data types that can be constructed from fundamental data types.
  - each compound data type has its own unique properties as well.

  - C++ supports the following compound data types:
    > functions
    > arrays
    > pointer types:
        ~ pointer to object
        ~ pointer to function
    > pointer to member types:
        ~ pointer to data member
        ~ pointer to member function
    > reference types:
        ~ L-value references
        ~ R-value references
    > enumerated types:
        ~ unscoped enumerations
        ~ scoped enumerations
    > class types:
        ~ structs
        ~ classes
        ~ unions
*/

/*
  - in this chapter, we'll cover some of the more straightforward compound types, including
        > l-value
        > references
        > pointers
        > unscoped enumerations
        > scoped enumerations
        > structs
*/
