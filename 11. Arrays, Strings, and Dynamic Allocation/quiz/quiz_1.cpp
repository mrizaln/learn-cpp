    Pretend youâ€™re writing a game where the player can hold 3 types of items: health
    potions, torches, and arrows. Create an enum to identify the different types of
    items, and an std::array to store the number of each item the player is carrying (the
    enumerators are used as indexes of the array). The player should start with 2 health
    potions, 5 torches, and 10 arrows. Write a function called countTotalItems() that
    returns how many items the player has in total. Have your main() function print the
    output of countTotalItems() as well as the number of torches.
