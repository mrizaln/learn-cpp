                    ============[ object composition ]============
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

/*
  - in real-life, complex objects are often built from smaller, simpler objects.
  - for example, you are build from smaller pars: you have a head, body, legs, arms, etc.
  - the process of building complex object from simpler ones is called [object composition].

  - object composition models a ["has-a"] relationship between two object.
  - the complex object is sometimes called the whole, or the parent.
  - the simpler object is often called the part, child, or component.

  - in C++, structs and classes can have data members of various types.
  - when we build classes with data members, we're essestially constructing a complex object
    from simpler parts, which is object composition.
  - thus, structs and classes are sometimes referred to as [composite types].

                ============[ types of object composition ]===========
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

/*
  - there two subtypes of object composition:
    1. composition      (discussed in this lesson)
    2. aggregate        (next lesson)
*/




/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        ============[ composition ]===========
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

/*
  - to qualify as a [composition], an object and a part must have the following relationship:
    1. the part (member) is part of the object (class)
    2. the part (member) can only belong to one object (class) at a time
    3. the part (member) has its existence managed by the object (class)
    4. the part (member) does not know about the existence of the object (class)

  - composition models ["part-of"] relationships.
  - example: a heart is part-of a body.

  - the parts of a composition can be singular or multiplicative.

  - conposition is often used to model physical relationships, were one object is physically
    contained inside another.
  - in a composition relationship, the whole object is responsible for the existence of the
    part.

  - compositions are typically created as structs or classes with normal data members.

/*
    Many games and simulations have creatures or objects that move around a board, map,
    or screen. One thing that all of these creatures/objects have in common is that they
    all have a location. In this example, we are going to create a creature class that uses
    a point class to hold the creatureâ€™s location.

/*
  - one question that new programmers often ask when it comes to object composition is,
    "when should i use a class member instead of direction implementation of a feature?".
*/

// [ tip ]
/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    a good rule of thum is that each class should be built to accomplish a single task.
    that task should either be the storage and manipulation of some kind of data, or the
    coordination of its members. ideally not both.
